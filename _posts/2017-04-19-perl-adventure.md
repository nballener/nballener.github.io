I love programming in Perl. It can do so many things in a large manner of
different ways. This can be great at times and not so great other times.

At time of writing, I would have around 5 odd years programming using Perl. It actually wasn't my main language at the time, I was just pushed into it at a work experience position. The story is, that when I was working there, they asked me to make a program that could help them streamline the way they reported on their errors. I was tasked to gather requirements from the stakeholders, the main developers there, and create a solution for them.

Whilst interviewing the team and gathering what information I could get, a developer gave me a look at some of the code he developed using Perl. I looked at it and extended upon it and created a solution for them. Needless to say, it may not have been my best work, as I was only my first real world position. But it did start me on the journey with Perl.

My current role is also in Perl and I also write puzzle books using Perl. Check it out here, [puzzlesbynilo.com](https://puzzlesbynilo.com "Puzzles By Nilo"). Haha shameless plug!

There is no way I am a Monk, nor do I claim to know much about Perl, but I
think I have some skills that I want to show you.

So come follow me through my random adventures programming in Perl.
