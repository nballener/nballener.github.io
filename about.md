My name is Nilo Ballener and I am a software developer by day and father of 2, well, all the time. I love programming. I think it consumes me sometimes. I've been dabbling around in development since high school where I was first introduced into HTML and Javascript. Back then it was very challenging but I did manage to create very basic websites on my home computer.

Through out high school I kept learning through school units and eventually decided to go to University to get a Bachelor of Telecommunication Engineering.

At first, it was interesting, but as I went through the courses, I found that I was more fascinated in the software side, rather than the hardware. At the end of 2nd year, I made my move and changed my degree. I eventually finished, with honours, my Bachelor of Software Engineering.
