# Introduction
While learning how to programming, you are taught the basic ways to coode.
"Hello, World" is most likely your first program you'll write. I know it was
mine and I think I've written a "Hello, World" program in at least different
programming language. Some times in the same programming language more than once!

Then further along your studies or experiences, you learn how do to other things
like, if conditionals, loops and functions. You may even learn how to program
using OOP or Functionally
