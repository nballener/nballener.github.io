* RUBY: Prawn
* Prawn::table
  * quick example
  * table position
  * table cell width/height
  * JSON to_sym
* THOUGHTS:
  * I choose to be language agnostic as I believe each language can have it's own strengths and uses
  * sometimes people get stuck in the one language when there are other languages more suited
  * example: I do my puzzle logic in perl and python, but when it comes down to creating pdfs, I'm going to switch to ruby. not because I stopped liking the previous languages, I just feel that ruby (at the time of writing this) is a better tool for pdf generation. Will this change in the future? of course. Same with all tooling.
* QUESTION:
  * why fix something that isn't broken? what if it was broken when it was made?
