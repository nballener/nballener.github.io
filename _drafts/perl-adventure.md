I love programming in Perl. It can do so many things in a large manner of
different ways. This can be great at times and not so great other times.
At time of writing, I would have around 5 odd years programming using Perl.
There is no way I am a Monk, nor do I claim to know much about Perl, but I
think I have some skills that I want to show you.

So come follow me through my random adventures programming in Perl.
