# Notes
*intro*

Currently I'm using Jekyll for my blog. It's easy to learn, uses Markdown, and it can be hosted on Github Pages.
I haven't been using it for very long and I was surprised at the

* 6:30 alarm
* Checking Pinterest
* Start diary entries
* Found out that you can add folders in the *\_drafts* folder and it will still show up when you serve it on Jekyll
* Sort out Google Drive folders
  * Cluttered workspace frustrates me
* Website is running slow
  * Ran google insights to check where it can be improved
  * Mobile: 64/100
    * Need to remove render blocking js and css
      * jquery
  * Focus is Mobile experience so will need to remove, or at least, move to footer
  * Added a plugin - "Script to Footer" that moved scripts to footer
    * Mobile: 75/100
  * Enabled WP Super Cache
    * Mobile: 65/100
    * Odd, but it's complainging about images, so I need to fix those
  * Disabled Jetpack (I don't use it anyway)
    * Mobile: 64/100
    * I think it's the images
