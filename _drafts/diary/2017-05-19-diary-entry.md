# Notes
* 6:30 alarm
* Checking Pinterest
* Start diary entries
* Found out that you can add folders in the *\_drafts* folder and it will still show up when you serve it on Jekyll
* Sort out Google Drive folders
  * Cluttered workspace frustrates me
* Website is running slow
  * Ran google insights to check where it can be improved
  * Mobile: 64/100
    * Need to remove render blocking js and css
      * jquery
  * Focus is Mobile experience so will need to remove, or at least, move to footer
