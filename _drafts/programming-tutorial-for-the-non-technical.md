# Purpose of this post
Typically programming, or coding, has been the domain of technical people. People who are analytical thinkers, scientists, engineers. But what I'm trying to do is make it more available to everybody, no matter how your brain works, by relating programming with real world, everyday things. My true goal is to teach me partner, who isn't typically technical minded, my 10 year old son, sometimes techincal sometimes not, and 1 year old daughter, I'm not sure what goes on in the little head yet.

In this tutorial, I will be focusing on some of the basic the concepts as opposed to actual code. For me, I've chop and changed many languages before, and they all focus of different things. How easy is it to read (readability)? How easy is it to add features (extendability)? How easy is it to test (testability)? But, for me, the basics seem to always stay the same.

# What's the point of learning how to program?
- Many things are now controlled by computers 
- tasks that used to be manual can now be automated
- Tasks are done quicker and with fewer mistakes
- Makes life easier

# What are variables?
Containers that hold different things
Simply put, variables are storage containers you can put values you are going to use later. These values can be made up of different types of things known as data types. Variables can be used over and over again and also the values can be changed.

You can think of a bucket as an example. You can start of off with an empty bucket, `bucket = 0`. Then go to the tap and put 5 litre of water in, `bucket = 5`. You go then go and empty out 3 litres of that bucket, `bucket = bucket - 3`. Finally, you display how much water you have left in the bucket, `print(bucket)`. What you get is a basic set of instructions

```
bucket = 0
bucket = 5
bucket = bucket - 3
print(bucket)
```

# What are data types?
Different things
Numbers
Text
Strings
Characters
Objects
Classes
Functions

# What are conditionals?
If else
Unless
# What are loops?
While
For
Foreach
# What are functions?
Grouped tasks
Typically things you do more than once
Does one thing
Reduce repetition in code
