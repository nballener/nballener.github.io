# Introduction

This is the second week of my work at my new position.
It's been more that fun

# Monday

- XML ISA tag and Name attribute needs to have a
  capital 'N'... derp...
- Always finding ways to create shortcuts to make my
  work faster and more streamline
- There are manual steps that need to be done to
  ensure the program will correctly work. Must remember
  these steps.
  - even better, write a mini program to do these for
    me
  - this is what they hired an engineer for, right?
- Bave had an interiew today with a recruiter, so we
  had lunch together first.
  - KFC was the restaurant of choice
  - Bird pooped on her head :)
  - lucky it was only dry

# Tuesday

- had to use a scarf today, over my nose and mouth
  because someone with smelly cigarette smoke clothes
  decided to sit next to me
- worked on PL SQL
  - this ended up being a challenge as I haven't had
    experience is this language before
  - it was fine until I had to look into locks and how
    I had to fiddle with them

# Wednesday 

# Thursday

# Friday

# Thoughts

- I'm sorry if you smoke, but it really offends me
- I pretty sure it's the smell of it on clothes and
  the dizzy feeling I get when you sit next to me on
  the train
- I don't care if you do as long as it doesn't affect
  me. But your stinky clothes offend me!
