# Introduction
From the moment you were born, up until the moment you read this post, you are learning. From walking and talking to driving a car. Learning new things is part of life and you will never stop.

Now just like life, you learn different skills as you grow older and times change. This is very relevant in your career as much as anything else. I think some people think that once you finish university or high school, there's nothing left to learn and you will always be relevant in the industry.

Nothing can be further than the truth.

In my experience, I have learnt more while out of school than when I was in it.

# Motivations for continuous learning
* Ever changing industry
As everything in life, things are constantly changing and updating. This is the same for any industry, especially the technology sector, you would have to be naive to think that it wouldn't. 
* Keep you knowledge up to date
