I have been in software development for around 5 years at time of this post and
I think I will be doing it until a die. Whether as a career or in my past time.

1. Programming in a Team is very different than on your own
2. Corporate code sucks
3. Results are not measure by quality of code but by the amount of money made
4. Quality is just a buzz word
