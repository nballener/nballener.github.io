## *introduction post*
### *should make a new one that dives deeper into each heading and dot point in post*

I have been in software development for around 5 years at time of this post and
I think I will be doing it until a die. Whether as a career or in my past time.

A current project I'm undertaking, outside of work, is my creation of puzzle books, [puzzlesbynilo](https://puzzlesbynilo.com "Puzzles By Nilo"). (Another shameless plug!)

It is written in various languages, predominantly Perl, with a little bit of Python thrown in the mix. I picked Perl because I use it every day and I knew I could get a product out faster using it.

My plan is to continue to use Perl for updates to current solutions whilst using other programming languages for other puzzle types. 

Now, during this time there are things that I've learnt along the way. Some things are good, even great, but others are bad. Well, bad in the sense that it's not the fairytale I thought it was going to be.

## 1. Programming in a Team is very different than on your own
When you enter a role of software development, you inevitably will have to work with a team.

* in person teams
* remote teams
* company should be seen as a team
    * should be no borders around departments
* external company/clients are also parts of the team
    * can argue that the customer is also a part

* if team feels good, I've found the work ends up being good
* sometimes a greater distraction

## 2. Corporate code sucks

* Legacy code
* "Procedure" prevents growth
* "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality
* Once off isn't once off

## 3. Results are not measure by quality of code but by the amount of money made

* Money makes the world go round
* Greed

## 4. Quality is just a buzz word

* Stems from the above
* As long as boxes are ticked quality is assumed
