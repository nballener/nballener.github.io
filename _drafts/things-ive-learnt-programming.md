I have been in software development for around 5 years at time of this post and
I think I will be doing it until a die. Whether as a career or in my past time.

A current project I'm undertaking, outside of work, is my creation of puzzle books, [puzzlesbynilo](https://puzzlesbynilo.com "Puzzles By Nilo"). (Another shameless plug!)

It is written in various languages, predominantly Perl, with a little bit of Python thrown in the mix. I picked Perl because I use it every day and I knew I could get a product out faster using it.

My plan is to continue to use Perl for updates to current solutions whilst using other programming languages for other puzzle types. 

1. Programming in a Team is very different than on your own
2. Corporate code sucks
3. Results are not measure by quality of code but by the amount of money made
4. Quality is just a buzz word
