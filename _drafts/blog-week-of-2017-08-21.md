  work for at the time of writing

# Introduction

- This is my work diary.
- Taking notes of what happens during my work week.
- Place where I can consolidate what I've learnt and observed
  while working at my new role as a Software Engineer II.

# Monday

- On the train close to 8 o'clock
- Bavy and children sent me to the station
- Can't believe how busy it is at the time. I suppose it is
  peak hour times
- Noticed that the train was oldly quiet, everyone was too
  immersed in the screen in front of them
  - I can be quilty of that sometimes
- Got in at around 8:55, pretty much on time for a 9 am
  start
  - New for me as I used to get in a lot latter as previous
    workplace
- Greeted by my manager and taken around for a quick tour
  around the office
  - quick because the office is small are there is only
    around 50 staff members
- Met my new team: Team Chaos
  - I soon discovered, was inspired by the work they tackle
- Everyone is warm, welcoming and laid back
- After that, was given a MacBook Pro for my workstation
  - A change as I'm used to Windows development
  - Excited as I also have root access on my machine
    - Something I didn't have in my previous role
    - Free to grab any open source tool I can get my hands
      on 

# Tuesday

- Got up at 4:30, sucks
- Really cold, but it's not so bad
- Seems that the train starts to get fuller at this time
- will try an earlier time
- interesting how people decide to choose train seats
- also interesting people's etique when it comes to
  peering over at somebody else's device screen.
