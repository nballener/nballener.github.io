# Introduction
In my current employment, I use Perl. When I prgram scripts at home, I use Perl. I make my puzzles and puzzle books, I use Perl. Which can be found here [puzzlesbynilo.com](https://puzzlesbynilo.com "Puzzle By Nilo") (Shameless plug). So I decided to switch it up a bit and learn something else. That something else was Python.

# Why Python
Since everything I do is in Perl, I thought that it would be nice to make a change. So I did my research and ended up with Python. 

Whilst doing my research, I thought that I would try going back to what I learnt in University, Java. Um, no... It is such a rich language and it seemed daunting to have to learn it again. I was so confident that the 5 year gap I had from Java didn't mean anything. I was wrong. I felt like I needed to go back to Uni.

Next was PHP. As I've done a little of it before, I thought I would give it another go. I was also inspired by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/ Laravel), a web framework that made the ugly PHP code into something beautiful. It kept me inspired for a little while, until I realised that I wasn't making a web app at the moment, I was making a desktop type application.
