# Career Experience

## Computershare - *Software Developer*

During a 2 year period, performed requirements gathering and analysis, contribute to the solution design and development of a print and digital communications solution. The software developed utilises a mixture of XML and CSV data. As a member of large team of business analysts and developers, we pioneered the implementation of a new communications system platform.

During a second 2 year period, developed a large software communications suite that utilises a mixture of XML, CSV, and flat file data (TXT). Pioneered several new business techniques which utilised web services and SSRS reports.

Introduced, developed and demonstrated an automated unit testing script that watches the current working directory and runs unit tests when it detects file saves. It has opened up a better programming standard to the larger team, with plans for national roll out. I received a Great Ideas award.

## Robert Bosch - *Student Engineer*

Autonomously gathered requirements and developed a suite of reporting tools using a mixture of perl and Excel VBA. I was required to learn what each system they used, extract and consolidate data from multiple sources, and produce reports with usable information and in a clear format.

Turn around times for defect reporting were dramatically reduced from an average of 60 seconds per defects, to 5 seconds for all outstanding defects.

# Personal Project

## Puzzles By Nilo

A series of puzzles books generated through software written in perl and python. The programs read in JSON configurations then produce PDFs, JPGs, and PNGs files.

Output PDFs are sent to a publisher, which is then distributed through Amazon and other book sellers. There are current 3 puzzles types available online at the moment: [Word Searches][1], [Number Searches][2] and [Number Fill In puzzles][3]

I also share free puzzles sheets and book on my website, [puzzlesbynilo.com][4], which uses Wordpress.

Further enhancements will be to use the [Wordnik][5] API or alternative to extract related words and meanings to generate crossword puzzles.
